## Description

This repository contains the crates for the IPFS core implementation which includes a blockstore, a libp2p integration which includes DHT content discovery and pubsub support, and HTTP API bindings. Our goal is to leverage both the unique properties of Rust to create powerful, performant software that works even in resource-constrained environments, while also maximizing interoperability with the other "flavors" of IPFS, namely JavaScript and Go.

### Project Status - `Alpha`

You can see details about what's implemented, what's not, and also learn about other ecosystem projects, at [Are We IPFS Yet?](https://areweipfsyet.rs)

For more information about IPFS see: https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/overview/

## Install

Rust IPFS depends on `protoc` and `openssl`.

### Dependencies

First, install the dependencies.

With apt:

```bash
$ apt-get install protobuf-compiler libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

With yum:

```bash
$ yum install protobuf-compiler libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Install `rust-ipfs` itself

The `rust-ipfs` binaries can be built from source. Our goal is to always be compatible with the **stable** release of Rust.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs && cd rust-ipfs
$ cargo build --workspace
```

You will then find the binaries inside of the project root's `/target/debug` folder.

_Note: binaries available via `cargo install` is coming soon._

## Getting started

We recommend browsing the [examples](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/tree/master/examples), the [http crate tutorial](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/tree/master/http#getting-started) and [tests](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/tree/master/tests) in order to see how to use Rust-IPFS in different scenarios.

### Running the tests

The project currently features unit, integration, conformance and interoperability tests. Unit and integation tests can be run with:

```bash
$ cargo test --workspace
```

The `--workspace` flag ensures the tests from the http and unixfs crates are also run.

Explanations on how to run the conformance tests can be found [here](https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/tree/master/conformance). The Go and JS interoperability tests are behind a feature flag and can be run with:
```bash
$ cargo test --feature=test_go_interop
$ cargo test --feature=test_js_interop
```

These are mutually exclusive, i.e. `--all-features` won't work as expected.

Note: you will need to set the `GO_IPFS_PATH` and the `JS_IPFS_PATH` environment variables to point to the relevant IPFS binary.

### Contributing

See [the contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

You can also back the project financially by reaching out or by becoming a backer on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/rs-ipfs)

If you have any questions on the use of the library or other inquiries, you are welcome to submit an issue.

## Maintainers

Rust IPFS was originally authored by @dvc94ch and now actively maintained by @koivunej, and @aphelionz. Special thanks is given to [Protocol Labs](https://github.com/protocol) and [Equilibrium](https://github.com/eqlabs).

## Alternatives and other cool, related projects

Itâ€™s been noted that the Rust-IPFS name and popularity may serve its organization from a "first-mover" perspective. However, alternatives with different philosophies do exist, and we believe that supporting a diverse IPFS community is important and will ultimately help produce the best solution possible.

- [`rust-ipfs-api`](https://github.com/ferristseng/rust-ipfs-api) - A Rust client for an existing IPFS HTTP API. Supports both hyper and actix.
- [`ipfs-embed`](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed/) - An implementation based on [`sled`](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-embed/)
- [`rust-ipld`](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipld) - Basic rust ipld library supporting `dag-cbor`, `dag-json` and `dag-pb` formats.
- PolkaX's own [`rust-ipfs`](https://github.com/PolkaX/rust-ipfs)
- Parity's [`rust-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p), which does a lot the of heavy lifting here

If you know of another implementation or another cool project adjacent to these efforts, let us know!
